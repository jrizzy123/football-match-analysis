# ⚽ Football Analysis System

An AI-powered football (soccer) analysis system that uses **YOLO**, **OpenCV**, and **Python** to automatically detect, track, and analyze players, referees, and the ball from match footage. This project demonstrates how computer vision and machine learning can be applied to sports analytics.

## 🚀 Features
- **Object Detection** – Detects players, referees, and the ball using YOLO.  
- **Player & Ball Tracking** – Tracks movements frame-by-frame to build trajectories.  
- **Team Classification** – Uses **jersey color clustering (K-Means)** to assign players to teams.  
- **Camera Motion Compensation** – Handles moving/stabilized camera footage for accurate analysis.  
- **Perspective Transformation** – Converts pixel positions into real-world field measurements.  
- **Performance Metrics** – Computes distance covered, speed, and positional heatmaps.
